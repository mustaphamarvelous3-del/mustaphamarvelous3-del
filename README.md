🦁 About Me

I am Mustapha Marvelous Oluwaferanmi, a Full-Stack Software Engineer and the Founder of Marvillyon Group. Based in Lagos, I specialize in architecting high-performance web solutions that solve complex business problems.

My journey has evolved from fashion design (DeTrend) to advanced software engineering. Today, I fuse these disciplines to build the Marvillyon Tech Labs and the upcoming Marvillyon Global Fashion Mall. I don't just write code; I build systems that scale, perform, and lead the market.

"Innovation is not just about building something new; it's about making the old obsolete."

🛠 Core Services

🔹 Custom Architecture & Development

Building robust, scalable websites and web applications from scratch. Whether it's a corporate platform, an e-commerce hub, or a complex SaaS product, I engineer the foundation for success using modern stacks (React, Node.js, Python).

🔹 Legacy System Modernization

Updating and upgrading old, outdated websites. I take slow, static, or broken sites and transform them into fast, mobile-responsive, and modern platforms that meet 2026 standards.

🔹 Feature Integration & Expansion

Injecting new life into existing platforms. Need a payment gateway, a user dashboard, or AI integration? I add advanced features to your current setup to make it stand out and perform better.

🔹 Technical Solutions & Debugging

Providing high-level solutions for websites with critical issues. From fixing bugs to optimizing load speeds and security, I ensure your digital presence is flawless.

🤝 Let's Work Together

I am open to high-impact contracts, partnerships, and technical consultancy. If you are ready to upgrade your vision, let's talk.
